# CodeAlpha_TaskName-


I worked on a new data analysis project about the 2024–2025 high school results as part of my internship with CodeAlpha.

I started with three main columns of data: seating_no, arabic_name , and total_degree.

Then I added a few more columns such as:
Each precentage_student.
Whether they successful or failed.
Who will repeat the year.

From this, I explored several insights:
The number of students in the year was 810,000.

I discovered that 0.493% of the students were repeating the year.

I also discovered that 3.41% of the students did not take the exam at all, which is a very large percentage.

I also discovered that the pass rate was 66%.

I also discovered that 2.67% of the students scored between 49.5% and 50%, which is a very large percentage.

I also discovered that the highest percentage was between 40% and 60%.

So I created a dashboard to explain all of this and clarify the idea more clearly.
This project is submitted under CodeAlpha Internship Tasks (Web Scraping, EDA, and Data Visualization).
I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions for improvement.
